# Deep-Learning-using-CNN
Implemented a binary classifier differentiating between cats and dogs using TensorFlow and Keras.
Employed image preprocessing techniques such as rescaling, shearing, and flipping.
Designed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with appropriate layers for feature extraction and classification.
Trained the model using a labeled dataset and achieved accuracy through Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss.
Evaluated the model's performance on a separate test set, demonstrating effective generalization.
Implemented a prediction mechanism for real-world image classification.
